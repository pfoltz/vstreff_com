Hi Vincent,

Thanks for writing!  

Sorry to say, I've nothing on the Streff line.  Only this census record for 1850.  I believe the 6 month old infant by the name of Nicholas is Susan's husband.  He would have been born at that time.  

1850 Dubuque City Iowa Census. In it are listed:

#181/183 
STROAF, Nicholas age 46 farmer born Germany (*course the name is misspelled)
Margaret age 38 born Germany
Nicholas age 15 born Germany
Michael age 12 born Germany
Susanna age 10 born Germany
John age 8 born Germany
Mathew age 5 born Germany
Joseph age 2 born Iowa
Nicholas age 6/12 born Iowa ****

No mention of family names of Mathias or Paul.  But the immigration time seems to be similar as their first child born in America came in about 1848 and to the Iowa state.

Sorry to say that I have no actual 'copy' of this census page, I just copied it down.  If I had, I could look up to see if either of your two ancestors were living close by.  Sorry.

Good luck in your research, take care, Barb.

  My name is Vincent Streff and I found your web site when searching for my ancestors.



  In generation 9, you show Susan Tritz married to Nicholas Streff.  Do you have any further information on this family and their nine children?



  I am descended from Mathias Streff (1818-1908) who with his brother Paul (1808-1898) came to America from Luxembourg probably around 1850.



  Any data you may have would be appreciated.



  Thank you,



  Vincent Streff
