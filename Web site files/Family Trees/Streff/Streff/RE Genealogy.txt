Hi again,

My grandmother is Logene Ann Streff b. may 9 1934 Salem, SD, daughter of Philemon Streff and Christina Hoenscheid.  She married Michael Ryman (b. june 28 1930 d. june 26 1980).  Their children are Bonnie Jean Ryman (my mother) b. dec 25 1956, David Ryman (b. jan 11 1958 d. 2004), Kurt Evan Ryman (b.aug 25 1961), Bruce Joseph Ryman (b. dec 28 1962 d. apr 30 1988), Janis Lyn Ryman b. jun 6 1966, Dennis Patrick Ryman b. mar 27 1971.

Dennis Ryman married Laura Jane Imus, they have two kids (twins) William and Felicia born in 2002.
Janis Lyn Ryman married Roderick Heath, they have two kids, Cassandra Alexis Heath b. 12 jun 1989 and Cordell "Cord" Gene Heath, b.15 jun 1991.
Kurt Evan Ryman is currently in the Air Force
Bruce Joseph Ryman died in 1988 of some kind of cancer in Redding, CA.
David Ryman died in 2004, of which I don't know any details.  I believe he had some drug problems which may be related to his death, but my mom won't say anything further.

Logene also married Robert Stone in the 80s, but did not have children with him.  He died a few years after they were married and I don't know anything about him.

My mom Bonnie married Rick Allen Pool
My sister's name is Laura Michelle Pool b. may 12 1986
Me Marie Lynn Pool b. oct 4 1984

I currently live in Riverside, CA, but I was born in Redding, CA where the majority of my family lives.  I went to college in Illinois (Lake Forest College) and know Michael Joseph Streff b. aug 2 1949 son of Laurel Joseph Streff.  I believe he lives in Champaign, IL and has two daughters.  The rest of Laurel's family lives in Apple Valley, CA, about an hour north of Riverside.  

Logene's sister Carole Ann Streff married Raymond Schneider and had eight kids.  They live in South Dakota.  Another sister, JoAnne Cecilia Streff married Dennis Sollie and have two kids, Rita Ann and Christopher.  They live in Tacoma, WA.   Philemon Streff and Christina Hoenscheid also had a daughter, Rita Ann Streff, who was born jan 22 1930 in Salem, SD.  She married Steve Vathkos (no kids).  Rita Ann Streff died dec 21 1961.

I'll try to send my gedcom file for the Streff family once I get all the kinks worked out.

  Hi Marie,



  Thanks for signing my guest book.  I would definitely be interested in anything you have on your branch of the family.



  Looking at what I have I see a Logene Streff but nothing under her. Anything you care to add, names dates, etc. will be added to my Streff online genealogy. 



  I’m glad you were able to access my online book.  I have been having trouble with my main web site and am trying to get the web host to fix the problem.



  Where do you live?  



  Do you know Tim Schieltz? He is descended from Maria (Marie) Streff who was my great grandfather Mathias Streff’s sister. Tim is also researching the family.



  Vince Streff

  Woodridge, Illinois
