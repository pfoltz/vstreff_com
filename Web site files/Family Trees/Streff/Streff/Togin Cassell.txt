Subject: Re: Family tree

Hello Vince--

The Streff family are ancestors of a cousin of my husband's, Marilyn Lee Pietrok Helm in Anaheim, California.  My husband and Marilyn are related on her mother's side, the Streff family is on her father's side.  Marilyn's e-mail address is   helmfamily@earthlink.net    
See her name in the outline below.  She would be happy to hear from you.  She has a lot of Streff photographs that have names that she is not sure how they fit into the family.

  Hello,



  My name is Vincent Streff and while researching my family tree I found the name Nicholas Streff in your Cassell family tree.  Do youhave any information about Nicholas?  My great-grandfather, Mathias Streff, (1819-1908), according to my father, had a brother Nicholas.  They came to America in 1846 from Luxembourg with at least two other brothers.  We think their father back in Luxembourg was named Michael and was born in the mid to late 1700s.



  You have quite an impressive tree.  If I could achieve even a fraction of what you have for my family, I would be delighted.



  Thank you.



  Vince Streff
