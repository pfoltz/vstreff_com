<H2 align=center>(The Illinois Central Railroad reached the site for Loda in May 
1854, and a depot was constructed at the milepost that summer. Loda celebrates 
150 years as a village on Aug. 7-8.)</H2>
<H4 align=center>&nbsp;</H4>
<H4 align=center><IMG height=321 src="Loda 2004_files/Hotel-in-Loda.jpg" 
width=471></H4>
<H5 align=center>(When the railroad came along, Loda began to grow at once. 
Along with a mill and houses was the hotel, site of early organizational 
meetings for the township and the village.)</H5>
<H2 align=center>Loda 150th to fete special citizens</H2>
<P align=left>LODA- One of the very first citizens of Loda was Adam 
<B>Smith</B>. He boarded a train in Chicago in 1854 on the new railroad called 
the Illinois Central.</P>
<P align=left>When the train stopped at the third station, 100 miles south of 
Chicago he decided to get off. All he could see was a depot, freight house and a 
lonely shack. But in his mind he saw a thriving city.</P>
<P align=left>He promptly bought 16,000 acres and began to develop it. He built 
churches, schools, stores, and shops, even a three-story hotel. Then he built a 
very large stately house. Now he had a place to call home. This is 150-year-old 
home still stands proud today.</P>
<P align=left>In 1855, Addison <B>Goodell</B> arrived in Loda. He also quickly 
became a leading businessman in this growing community. His first business 
adventure was a lumber mill.</P>
<P align=left>In the late 1850s the town was booming. Many people found jobs at 
the distillery, which was located on the southwest side of town. At the height 
of production it employed 100 men and produced 75 barrels of wine, selling at 12 
to 14 cents a gallon..</P>
<P align=left><B>Bought Smith House</B></P>
<P align=left>In 1872 <B>Goodell</B> bought the stately Smith home. In 1954, 
when Loda celebrated its 100th birthday, the mayor was Addison <B>Goodell</B>, 
great-great grandson of its founder. On Aug. 7, at the 150th birthday 
celebration, Warren <B>Goodell</B>, another descendent of Addison, will be grand 
marshall of the 11 a.m. parade. He will also tell some special memories during 
the opening ceremonies.</P>
<P align=left>Also at that time Loda will pay tribute to three of its oldest 
citizens who were born, raised and still make Loda their homes. So on Aug. 7, 
residents can bring their lawn chairs, take in the 11 a.m. parade and opening 
ceremonies and spend some time in the park playing games and visiting with old 
and new friends.</P>
<P align=left>Following is a short history of the three oldest residents born, 
raised, and still residing in Loda.</P>

<H5 align=center><B>One of the floats entered in the 1954 Loda centennial parade 
featured some of those who were the oldest born, raised and still living in 
Loda. From left are Vincent, Annette, Barbara and Josephine David, plus and 
unidentified staff member from the office of U.S. Sen. Paul Douglas.</B></H5>
<P align=left>Josephine "Jo" Marie <B>(Streff) Davis</B> was born on a farm 
northwest of Loda in April 1918. Her parents were William and Elizabeth 
<B>(Endres) Streff.</B></P>
<P align=left>She was the youngest of six children, all being girls. Because she 
had no brothers, she helped with many farm chores such as milking the cows, 
gathering eggs, shocking oats and husking corn. She attended the Streff one-room 
county school for grades one to eight. Then she attended Loda High School.</P>
<P align=left>After graduation she began working for Loda Poultry Co. In 1940 
her family moved to town. Their home was located on Washington Street, west of 
the elevator.</P>
<P align=left><B>The David union</B></P>
<P align=left>In March of 1943, Jo married Vincent <B>Davis</B> while he was 
home on leave from the Army. They immediately moved to California, but by 
December they were back in Loda, living in a home on South Locust Street. In 
1954 they moved one block south to the home Jo still lives in.</P>
<P align=left>Jo became a stay-at-home mom, taking care of her two sons and 
three daughters. In 1950 she became a part-time rural mail carrier, later 
becoming the full time carrier. She retired in 1983.</P>
<P align=left>Today she enjoys her garden and volunteering for her church and a 
Paxton nursing home.</P>
<P align=left>She has many friends and memories from her years in Loda. One of 
her favorites happen in winter. There was so much snow that her family used a 
sled and two horses to travel into town to attend church. When her dad made a 
quick turn to park the sled and horses, the sled turned over and dumped all six 
girls into the snow.</P>
<P align=left><IMG height=236 src="Loda 2004_files/Rasmus-and-Healey.jpg"

<P align=left>Donald Glen <B>Rasmus</B> was born in December of 1920. His family 
lived on Mockingbird Hill, which is now Lake Iroquois. His parents were Willie 
and Christine <B>(Dale) Rasmus</B>.</P>
<P align=left>Don was the 12th of 14 children, eight boys and girls. In 1928, he 
moved with his family to a home on West Lincoln Street. Today, G &amp; D Salvage 
is located there. He attended the old three-story brick school. <B>Rasmus</B> 
joined the Army in September 1942. During World War II he was stationed in the 
Philippines, where he worked as a cook.</P>
<P align=left><B>Back in Loda</B></P>
<P align=left>In April 1946, after four years of Army life, he returned to Loda 
and married Cleda <B>Williamson</B>. Their first home was on South Elm 
Street.</P>
<P align=left><B>Rasmus</B> later moved to North Poplar Street, where he lived 
until the spring. He is now a resident at the Illinois Knights Templar Home in 
Paxton. <B>Rasmus </B>has two sons and two daughters. He retired from Chanute 
Air Force Base in 1979. </P>
<P align=left><B>Rasmus</B> remembers a lot of fun times and has many good 
friends. But most of all he remembers riding his horse named Star all over town. 
When he grew tired of his horse he would ride his Harley. </P>
<P align=left>Charles Gaylord <B>Healey</B> was born in January 1925. His 
parents were Charles and Faye <B>(Robbins) Healy</B>. He had one sister and one 
brother.</P>
<P align=left>His family home was located on North Chesnut Street, north of 
where Weber's is located. He attended grade school in the old brick public 
school and the Loda High School.</P>
<P align=left>In May 1943, he joined the U.S. Army Corps, where he was in pilot 
training. But because of asthma he was never allowed to become a pilot, but 
instead became a gunner and radio man on a B-17. He worked seven days a week, 
eight hours a day instructing others.</P>
<P align=left>In February 1946 he returned to Loda and begun working at WKIO 
radio station in Urbana. Healey met his wife, Betty Jeanne <B>Herath</B>, in 
1946, when Betty moved into the apartment in the upper level of his mother's 
home on East Washington Street in Loda. Betty was teaching school at the 
time.</P>
<P align=left>They were married in February 1947. They had seven children, three 
boys and four girls. Chuck and Betty still ive in the home. Charles also worked 
for the family business, LoPoCo, and in 1970 began working for the Illinois 
Department of Transportation. He retired in 1990.</P>
<P align=left>As a young boy he enjoyed horsing around in the old train station. 
He also enjoyed playing pick-up games of basketball with his friends. In fact, 
on his wedding day he had a black eye which he got from an elbow during a rough 
game of basketball. </P>
<P align=left>Today <B>Healey</B> enjoys volunteering at the community theater 
in Paxton, where he is in charge of lights and sound. But most of all he really 
enjoys irritating his wife.</P>
