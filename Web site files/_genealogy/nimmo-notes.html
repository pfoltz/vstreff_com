<hr><b>  <P>Kitty Nimmo Campbell wrote this about her father, James  Shearer Nimmo:</P></b>

<font face="Bookman Old Style"><P>          "I was only nine years old when he was lost and Barbara (Nimmo Furey) was eleven years. I remember him quite plain.  I will tell you what mother always told us.  Father was on Burrell Ships Merchant Service.  They had a lot (of ships) all called Straths -- Strath Eern, Strath Lee, Strathmore.  I'm not sure which one Father was on when he was lost.  He was thirty-three and had his captain`s ticket, but he took a chief mate's job on his last voyage.  They sunk with all hands in a cyclone around San Francisco.  Nothing was heard of them, only a false report a year after.  Another ship had put our men's names on.  We always thought they would have been cast away on an island and would come back.  It was years before we gave up hope.  I remember dreaming before we heard the news, that I was going down with him on a ship, and we were singing a hymn.  His father dreamt he saw him between two coffins.</P>
<p>          "He (James' father) took Father to sea when he was thirteen and made him climb the riggings in the dark.  He (James) said he was afraid, but he had to do it and he was at sea until he was drowned.  He was only thirty-three and just getting on.  He was before the mast, then second mate, then chief and passed for captain before he was thirty.  He passed his exams at the Merchants' College South Shields.
</p>
<p> "He (James) was a very restless man, always wanting to get on, always wanting to feel a ship under him and never stayed long at home.  He used to walk in his sleep.  One night when he was chief mate, he got up and turned the wheel right round to another course and didn't know anything about it until the morning.  If he hadn't done it, they would all have been on the rocks that night, as the captain was drunk.  Father was a good swimmer and had two medals for saving life.
</p>
<p>         "I remember Mother taking us to meet him at the ports when he came home.  He thought a lot of his two grown-up daughters, as he called us.  The sailors used to carry us up and down the decks.  When we were having our dinners on board, he used to say eat up, your father hasn't to pay for it.  We were going on the next voyage with him, but it never came off.</p>

<p>          "He was full of jokes, always teasing us and he always had his pockets full of things for us -- scents, ribbons, ostrich feathers, etc. and we had to hunt for them.  He put money in the bank for us every time he came home.</p>

<p>          "Mother was left with five of us to bring up.  David was only nine months old.  The owners thought a lot of him (James) and sent Mother 200 pounds.  He was a good father while he lived; it was hard loosing him so soon.  I remember crying for days after we got the sad news.  It would have been November of 1890.  Burrell gave George (James' son) his first ship as third engineer.  They sold their ships in the First World War.  I've heard there are some more Straths now, but they don`t belong to Burrell's.</p>

<p>          "His family were Scots for generations back. I think this is about all I know.  I hope it will be of some interest to you."</p></font>

  <b>The following came from Mary Anne (Nan) Campbell Duckworth, Kitty Nimmo Campbell's daughter.</b>

<font face="Bookman Old Style"><p>          "I remember my Grandma Nimmo (Christina Miller) very well.  She lived with us for a while when I was about sixteen.  She was small and neat, beautifully dressed and always wore a gold watch on a chain around her neck, also a tartan skirt.  She had blue eyes and a lovely skin,
though she was in her seventies.  Her hair was grey, but Mother said when she was young, her hair was black, and she was called a Scottish beauty.  I remember she was always telling me to use glycerine and rose water to keep my hands nice.</p>

<p>          "Her energy was amazing.  I remember on a Sunday almost racing down the bank to her Kirk, as she called it, that was a primitive Methodist church.  She took me once.  They were all singing and clapping hands, which seemed very strange to me, after our quiet church.</p>

<p>           "I think they (she and James Nimmo) must have been very much in love.  I wish I had asked more, but I got the impression it wasn't quite approved by the family."</p>

<p>(Note:  Barbara Miller and James Nimmo were first cousins.)</p>  

<p>           "When Uncle George came from Australia, he told me he went to find relations in Leith in Scotland, (that was where they came from).  He found two aunts, but they closed the door and wouldn't have anything to do with him.  He was rather hurt.</p>

<p>          "Mother told me she wanted to marry her cousin, also, one of the Craigs.  We seemed to be inclined that way.
</p>
<p>          "My mother adored her father; she was his favourite.  She remembered being carried about the ship by the sailors.  He (James Nimmo) told her to learn to read the clock, and he would bring her a little sailor suit back.  She was ready, but sadly, he never came back from sea.  The ship went down in a whirl-pool (hurricane?) somewhere off San Francisco.</p>

<p>         "Also, Granddad's father was very tough and made him climb the rigging when he was only a little boy.  He must have been terrified.  According to my mother, Granddad loved the sea, couldn't wait to get back, and because his ship wasn't ready, he took a lower position from captain on another ship - his last voyage.  The shipping company helped with the family's education, I understand.</p>

<p>          "Grandma was quite well educated herself.  She used to speak French to me, which of course I didn't understand.  And how she loved playing the organ, but only hymns.  Her favourite was "Cross the River Jordan".</p>

<p>          "Sorry I don`t know any more about them, except they were related to the Crawfords, the biscuit firm."</p>[ <a href="#top">back
