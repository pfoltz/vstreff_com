<p>The oldest written sources of information about the K&uuml;bel
family are contained in the diary of Johann Ludwig K&uuml;bel, born 1644,
died 1707 at Heilbronn, Germany. This diary was continued by his
grandson Heinrich Franz Ludwig K&uuml;bel, tax collector at Heilbronn.</p>

<p>The family coat of arms as displayed by the Abbott Conrad zu Sch&ouml;nthal and as incorporated in his painting as well as in the one depicting the Hospital Vicar Philipp Friedrich K&uuml;bel consists of a black wing with 12 prongs, in the middle of the wing is a leg.  The field is azure blue (ala nigra, in cujus medio os sive tibia cadaverica in campo caerulso).</p>
<p>The Motto of the family is: "Vivat post funera virtus", which was already accepted by the Abbott.  The symbolism of the Abbott stated: "Fuge, tace, quiesce", which means Flee, be silent, rest, while a free translation of of the motto means: "The virtue of a man, i.e. what good he has created during his lifetime, continues to live after his death."</p>

<hr>	<p><b>THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY</b></p>
<p>The K&uuml;bel family originated at Heilbronn.  J&auml;ger, in his History of Heilbronn and its surroundings, describes it as the oldest family of the City of Heilbronn.   This
opinion is concurred in by D. Joh. Matth Faber's history of Heilbronn, and includes it within the most famous
families of the city.
<p>Perhaps already during the year 1277 a K&uuml;bel possessed
a part of the last Federal lien, which during that year was
exchanged by King Rudolph with the Cloister Maulbrunn.  While 
during 1368 Maulbrunn having loaned this land to the City
of Heilbronn, a Heinss (sic) K&uuml;bel against an annual rental of
5 shillings, held a lien on a garden in the "Leimengruben",
this lien subsequently transferred to the city.
The nature of a lien would justify the assumption that it
remained within the family.  </p>
<p>The first name of this K&uuml;bel
 of the year 1277 may have been Albert (or Albrecht).
At any rate during the year 1284 - only seven years later -
one of this name donated to the Cloister Sch&ouml;nthal, a 
vineyard which remained in the possession of the Cloister up to its dissolution.  
Besides this one,
in the year 1294, a Konrad K&uuml;bel is mentioned - perhaps a
brother of the one mentioned above.  He is mentioned as a
witness in documents of Sch&ouml;nthal.  In the year 1311, Konrad
Kubel donated his possessions to the Cloisters Sch&ouml;nthal
and Obristenfeld and Albert K&uuml;bel donated a wine press to
the Cloister Sch&ouml;nthal.</p>
 <p>It appears that Konrad and his sister Adelheid are children of 
 one of these two K&uuml;bels.  Konrad and Adelheid took the
vows and donated to the Cloister Sch&ouml;nthal a farm located in
Heilbronn.  More presumably they were children of Konrad K&uuml;bel
because he donated all of His holdings within the City of Heilbronn
to Cloister Sch&ouml;nthal and to the Cloister Obristenfeld
with the exception of his residence, which after their fathers
death was likewise donated to the Cloister by the two children.
Besides being pious and charitable by birth, no doubt they were
prompted in the actions by the fact that Konrad was an Abbott
at Sch&ouml;nthal while Adelheid was Abbott at Obristenfeld.  His
reign at Sch&ouml;nthal appears not be solely successful. 
In 1319 he submitted his resignation.  He is buried within 
the Cloister Sch&ouml;nthal and an oil painting adorns the
church.  </p><p>      The cloister records contain the following inscription 
about him: "Postea Conradus venit ad sublima natus; fato est-correptus,
 celestia gaudia adeptus."
     <p> It is quite evident that these two persons having lived under
 the vows of chastity could not be the originators of subsequent
 K&uuml;bel heirs and since their father, Conrad, already in the year 1311
 has donated all of his possessions to the cloister, it should not
 be assumed that he had any additional children.  It is most probable 
that with him and his children one branch of the family died
 out and that the succeeding branch is descending from his brother
Albert (or Albrecht).  Nothing can be ascertained with certainty,
 and the assumption that Heinss (sic) K&uuml;bel, who was previously mentioned
during 1368 was lien holder of a Federal lien at the time of
transfer of a garden in the "Leimengrube towards the field", had been
a son of Albert, even so if probable, still it remains an assumption.</p>

    <p>  During the year 1431 we again  find a Hans K&uuml;belin, 
(the diminutive "lin" instead of "lein" presumably because of his size) as
lessor of a city meadow and during the year 1450, a Hans K&uuml;bel, 
presumably the same one, as usufructuary of the "rain im Rosenberg am
Neckar bis zum Kalkofen". Between the Heinss of the year 1368 and
the one mentioned above, there appears to be one generation lacking.
Wether the latter was already the owner of the "K&uuml;belinsw&auml;ldlein"
at the Weinsbergerweg as is still known today and which at that
time most probably covered a much larger area, we do not know for
certain. Perhaps the family name was derived from this little forest,
family names have been introduced during the 10th and 11th century
only.</p>
    <p> Beginning with 1450 there is again a gap in the family register
which may have lasted for one generation.  In prayer books of the
city of Heilbronn, the name K&uuml;bel appears quite frequently (especially
the name Hans K&uuml;bel) so during 1399, 1450, 1458, 1461, 1470, 1473,
1474, 1477, 1483, 1492, 1495, 1498, 1501, 1504, 1507, 1510, 1519.
Nothing but the name is known of these people.</p>
 <p>    According to a rent register of a church, a Hans K&uuml;bel during
1514 paid 3 guilders rent for a vineyard in the "Stauffenberg".
From 1526 until his death in 1544, he was member of the City Council,
 finally in fourth position after the Mayor.  He therefore
lived during the stirring times of the Reformation and the Peasant's
War. He was fortunate to endure the danger of the pest which raged
from 1491 to 1529 and which called for over 2,000 victims in Heilbronn.</p>
<p>     A Hans K&uuml;bel, presumably the same one since he likewise is said
to have died during 1544, was married to a wife by name of Agnes and
who accepted the reformed evangelical teachings.</p>  
<p> <button style="background-color: white;" onClick="window.location = '#top'">Table of Contents</button></p>

 <hr>        <a name="tree"></a>  <b><p>The FAMILY TREE</p></b>
<p>   The names of those members of the family who have sired
the succeeding generation are typed in capital letters.</p>

<p>The uninterrupted succession of generations can only be
proven without a doubt beginning with STEPHAN KUBEL who presumably 
was a grand-son of Hans K&uuml;bel who died in 1544. 
STEPHAN KUBEL was a parson and died in Heilbronn in 1604.  He is 
therefore to be considered the originator of the K&uuml;bel family as
it exists today. Of his sister Susanna we know only the month
of her birth, March 1559.</p>
  <a name="gen2"></a> <p>   <u>II. Second generation.</u></p>
<p> Mag. GEORG K&Uuml;BEL, the son of the above mentioned, was
 Parson at Kleiningersheim from 1625 to 1626.  He was married
 with Katharine, nee Renz from Bietigheim.</p>
<p> <button style="background-color: white;" onClick="window.location = '#top'">Table of Contents</button></p>
 <a name="gen3"></a>    <p><u> III. Third Generation</u></p>
<p>  We can consider only his youngest son, STEPHAN K&Uuml;BEL, who was
  born in 1604.  l6l9 he learned how to write from city scribe
  Wernher Feucht at Leonberg, 1622 he joined city scribe Luccejus
  at Brackenheim, 1625 he joined city scribe Steglin at Waiblingen
  and thereafter he became Assistant Court scribe at Leonberg. 1631
  he became schoolteacher and Court scribe at Asperg. However, 
because of illnes he had to resign in 1632.  During 1656 he was
  Court scribe at Oberrieringen. the clerical Administration of
  Gr&ouml;ning&euml;n and he was assistant caretaker of the Lorch Administration.
  On Juno 15, 1641 he became Hospital scribe, on July 28, 1642
 he became a citizen of Heilbronn. He died on February 5, 1646. 
 He entered a second marriage with Anna Marie, widow
 of Daniel Krauss, butcher at Heilbronn.  Her father was Hans Drautz,
 vintner at Heilbronn. Her mother was Klara, nee Klingler.  After Stephan's 
 death, she entered into a third marriage with the tradesman Hans Loos.</p>

    <p>  <u>IV. Fourth Generation.</u></p>
  <p>JOHANN LUDWIG K&Uuml;BEL, was born June 17. 1644.  For four years
  he served as an apprentice with his step-father Hans Loos. For three
 additional years he served with the merchant Emmerich at Strassburg,
 until his mother,upon the death of his step-father recalled him to her own
  enterprise, where he remained until his marriage. 
  His mother died September 8,1679,at the age of 75.
 </p> <p>On May 16, 1678 he was elected a member of the Great Council,
on April 27, 1682, a member of the City Court, on September 1,
1691 he was accepted in the Inner Council and on August 4, 1698
he was elected Tax Administrator,  He died on May 3, 1707.</p>
     <p>He was first married with Marie Christine, daughter of the
City Court Assessor Philip Adam Pfeil of Heilbronn and  Mario
Magdalene, nee Hofsess. She was born November 23. 1650, married
February 27, 1672 and she died February 16, 1700. </p> 
     <p>In accordance to the diary mentioned in the preamble,
started with his wedding day February 27, 1642, he submitted
to the oath as citizen on April 12, l672, performed his first
citizen watch on the 19th and had to serve his first serfdom 
services on June 13, l672.  On February 15, 1675 we find the 
following entry: "Between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning under the
sign of Gemini by the Grace of GOD she gave birth to a child".
At all of the later births he has always mentioned the Zodiak
Sign under which the birth fell.  On January 17, 16 74 he reports
about a devastating fire which took place at Wimpfen and under
date of June 6, 1674 he reports about a battle having taken place
between the Imperial troops and the French near S&uuml;msheim in the
in spite, the latter in spite of their higher losses remained
victorious because of their superior numbers» It is than stated:
"After the above victory the City of S&uuml;nsheim has been occupied
by the French, it was pillaged and devastated, the whole 
"Bergstrasse" too has been pill-aged and burned even the fruits in
the fields have been spoiled and destroyed.  GOD have mercy on
the poor people". . Apparently this reference pertains to the battle
of Sinsheim at which time the French lost 180 Officers and 1100
men in killed personnel.</p>

<p><u>Recollections of her father and grandfather by Anita Kuebel Streff.</u></p>
<p><i>The following are excerpts from letters and other notes left by Anita.</i></p>
<p>"My dad <i>(Joseph)</i> and grandfather <i>(Charles A. Kuebel, Sr.)</i> always had riding horses and our boys <i>(Joseph Owen and Omer Frederick)</i> had custom made gigs made especially for them by someone closely akin to my dad.  I remember he traveled extensively to New York, Chicago and different parts of the USA and also to Mexico, Cuba and other countries.</p>
<p>"My grandfather was a versatile man with many interests - furniture manufacturer (Crescent Furniture Co.), a cooperage, a tannery (raw hides, minks, etc.), brewery interests and even thought of freezing strawberries in <u>1910</u>.  (They called him a dreamer.)  Also, he raised grapefruit on the shores of Lake Pontchatrain - had 80 acres.  They said he was mad to think anyone would ever eat grapefruit.  This land now sells for $10,000.00 for a 50 ft. lot."  <i>(Note: she wrote this in 1968.)</i></p>
<p>"My father believed in Orville Wright.  He believed we would see a person on the other <u>end</u> of a <u>telephone</u>.  Again, they thought he was nuts.  He had one of the first automobiles in New Orleans.  We had inside plumbing when others did not.  We had the only telephone around and a self-opening <u>carriage gate</u> - another of his <u>mad ideas</u>.  He was also one of the first owners of a talking machine (phonograph) with the cylinders.</p>
<p>"They were jobbers and owned several amusement pavilions with all of the Mills Novelty equipment. They also had one of the first strawberry preserve factories.  (I believe on Howard Street.)</p>
<p>"But fate stepped in and my beautiful and talented mother died needlessly, leaving a newborn babe, my sister <i>(Mae Carmel)</i>.  My father was a dazed man for he was very young.  He had money to be sure, but without my mother he was lost.  Had she lived, who knows what would have happened - but God know best."</p>
